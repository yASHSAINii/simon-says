SIMON-POD
It is my first worth uploading project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

This is the project where i am showcasing my skills related to webdev. i created this webpage where you can play this game which is called simon-pod. 
Simon-pod is a fun memory game inspired by the classic Simon-says!. The game challenges your memory and reaction time by showing you a sequence of button presses that you need to repeat in the correct order.

Feel free to check it out and have fun while making your memory stronger.
